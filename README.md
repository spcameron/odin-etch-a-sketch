# Etch-a-Sketch

This is the fourth project in TOP. The goal of the project is to build a browser based etch-a-sketch or sketchpad that employs recent lessons in DOM manipulation and flexbox layout.

This first iteration of the project represents the most basic requirements of the project scope. A draw screen of fixed dimensions is centered in the browser window and initially drawn with a 16x16 grid of squares. By hovering the mouse over a square within the draw screen, the background color of the square changes to represent a "filled in" square, and that color persists as the mouse moves out of the square. A button above this draw screen is also rendered, and by clicking on this button, the user can clear the draw screen and resize it with smaller or larger squares.

I would like to continue working on this project. There are many features that seem challenging but doable, such as changing the "color in" effect to only happen while the mouse button is held down, adding a shading/lightening ability with gradients, making other colors available and/or a "rainbow mode", adding an erase feature, and more. I would also like to use the opportunity to practice my CSS and layout skills further, with plans to stylize the page to somewhat resemble the classic red etch-a-sketch toy.
